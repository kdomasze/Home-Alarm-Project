Raspberry Pi Home Alarm project done in a team of 2 for EECS 113 at UCI. The project utilized a Raspberry Pi and a circuit designed and created by us which read in analog data, determined ambient levels for those sensors, and then sounded an alarm when an adjusted maximum was crossed.

The project makes use of an ADC MCP3008 that required SPI protocol for reading the sensor data.
